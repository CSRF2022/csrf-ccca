# Run the basic model fit and projection simulation
# -------------------------------------------------
#
#   A default parameters file (params) comes with the package. It is a list
# with options needed to fit the P/B model and run projections. The mapply
# step just moves each list object into the global environment rather than
# calling the list element each time in Monte Carlo simulations so it is
# faster and it also does not alter the base parameterisation in the list
# so you can return to it later.

# Two critical steps:
# 1. Fit a SP model to get the production/biomass (PB)
# 2. Get the relationship between P/B and the env variable (EV)

# with the index bumped by q

#Develop the PB projection values based on the P/B vs E fit and the
# E projection you specified above.
# When add.residuals=1 then a residual is sampled for each time step of each

# If the P/B vs E fit is relatively unbiased then it will not make
# much difference to the median but it will increase the future uncertainty.
# If you set it =0 then the residual is not added and you will have
# less uncertainty in the future. If the P/B vs E model is biased,
# this bias will be more likely to be carried forward if residuals
# are not sampled (=0).

# What is clear from the projections is that a decrease in temperature
# from the baseline is not good for the stock while an increase in
# temperature is certainly not good. What is more surprising is that even
# if mean temperature is the same as the baseline but there is an
# important increase in variance of the temperature, this is perhaps the
# worst case for the stock. There is a larger perentage of the P/B density
# &lt;0 for the increased variance scenario than for any other scenario

# Climate conditioning factors and deriving risk based advice
# -----------------------------------------------------------
#
#   You can determine climate conditioning buffer factors from the contour
# plot (Fig 10) for the particular objective. So if the acceptable risk
# level is 50% (a target) then one can follow the 0.5 contour to see what
# the maximum exploitation rate could be for various future temperatures.
# The buffering factor would be the ratio of the long term mean
# temperature exploitation on the 50% risk contour with that at the
# proposed future temperature. The buffering factor is the incremental
# risk buffer. If one were interested in incremental risk of status quo
# fishing then they would plot the exploitation rate of long term mean
# temperature and status quo exploitation and determine on what risk
# contour it landed. Then do the same with the hypothesised future median
# temperature and status quo exploitation rate. The difference between the
# two risk levels is the incremental risk.
#
# Incremental risk of assuming turbot production is affected by climate
# change vs not being affected can also be calculated by looking at how
# much the exploitation rate would need to change under one of the climate
# scenarios vs the null model. This incremental risk is the risk of
# assuming climate change is not important given your objective and future
# climate scenario.

# The contour plot and climate conditioning factors essentially show the
# dependence of reference points on the environmental conditions. Ideally
# a reference point is relatively invariant to external factors but the
# reality is that none are. The domed contours over the temperature
# dimension esssentially show degree of variance caused by change in the
# environment and climate change in what are essentially dynamic reference
# points.
